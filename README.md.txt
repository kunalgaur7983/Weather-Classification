This repository contains deep learning project. Deep learnig is one of the most popular fields in the recent years and is applicable to many fields, such as computer vision and image processing. In this repository, I have created Weather Classification web app using (Convolutional Neural Network) VGG19-CNN. In this project, we refer to weather classification from images as the task of predicting the class of the weather given an image(e.g., cloudy,rainy, shiny and sunny). I have got accuracy as 99.21%.
